# Love-Log App

## The app that makes your dating experience whole!

About Love-Log:
- ***What** will the application do?*
  - In the age of online dating and social media, finding your love-match among the many options you have, can get overwhelming. This app allows you to keep track of the dozen dates you have been on, make logs, rate them, create personalized notes and reminders, as well as journals.
- ***Who** will use it?*
  - The app is appropriate for anyone from teenagers finding their *first love* to adults looking for their *true love*.This app makes the process of narrowing down the candidates to the most compatible one easy and fun. 
- ***Why** is this project of interest to you?*
  - I personally find dating exhausting as you have to try to remember all the details and later recollect those to make the decision of whether you want to following through with the person or not. This becomes specially burdensome when there are multiple "suitors" ðŸ˜„. Such an app creates room for more organized thoughts and clearer evaluation of the dates.
